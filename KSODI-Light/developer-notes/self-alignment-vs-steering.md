# KSODI-Light Steering, Self-Alignment and Observer-Based Monitoring

KSODI-Light can support reflective self-alignment patterns in assistants, such
as asking for clarification, keeping uncertainty visible, and adapting the
strictness of K/S/O/D/I expectations to the interaction context.

KSODI-Light can also support lightweight prompt-level steering when K/S/O/D/I
expectations, score corridors or fallback rules are embedded into a user,
account, developer or system prompt.

At this level, KSODI-Light is best understood as a reflective working
agreement. It may apply to user input, assistant output or the shared
interaction state across a turn.

This does not make KSODI-Light a formal observer architecture.

Strong external monitoring, long-term drift analysis, enforced corridor
intervention and auditable observer feedback belong to Standard-Eval,
KSODI-Full or IDAS-level implementations.

## Light-Level Self-Alignment

At the KSODI-Light level, an assistant may be instructed to:

- ask for clarification when the request is unclear,
- make uncertainty visible,
- avoid judging users,
- adapt objectivity requirements to the task context,
- keep interaction quality discussable,
- accept user feedback when the answer does not fit the shared frame.

Examples:

- image discussion may require high objectivity and cautious identification,
- poetry or science-fiction reflection may allow lower objectivity and more
  imaginative exploration,
- research support may require explicit source boundaries and uncertainty
  labels.

These are guidance patterns. They may guide behavior inside a prompt, but they
are not yet an external observer.

For multi-agent, MoE or embodied-agent interaction settings, this suggests a
cautious working hypothesis: KSODI-Light can function as a local orientation
counterpart for individual participants, while formal observers remain external.
The local layer can make clarification, uncertainty, grounding and fallback
behavior available inside the interaction. The external layer can then monitor
drift, trajectory movement and corridor exits across participants.

This should not be read as a claim that KSODI-Light creates autonomous
self-alignment or replaces technical safety methods. It is a prompt-level
orientation layer that may support more stable feedback behavior when combined
with suitable observer and control architectures.

## Architecture-Agnostic Does Not Mean Input-Agnostic

KSODI is intended to be architecture-agnostic: it can be discussed across
chatbots, RAG systems, agent workflows, multi-agent systems, MoE-like settings
or embodied-agent layers.

However, architecture-agnostic does not mean input-agnostic.

Before implementation or testing, developers and system architects must decide
very carefully what is allowed to enter the five operators `K`, `S`, `O`, `D`
and `I`. The selected input frame, reference space, retrieval context, tool
state, memory boundary, system/developer instruction context and operator
mapping directly affect all later layers.

If the operator input is chosen poorly, the system may not simply produce a
weak score. It may observe a different interaction state than intended.

This is especially important for observer-supported agentic systems. The
Observer can only interpret drift, acceleration, corridor exits, relational
coherence or recovery feedback meaningfully if the earlier K/S/O/D/I operator
inputs have been defined with sufficient care.

The revised KSODI 3.5 line, currently under testing and described in the paper
work, is intended to provide a clearer example of this operator filling for a
chatbot scenario. The related public guidance will be found under
Standard-Eval and KSODI-Full after publication of the reviewed v3.5 material.

The corresponding full implementation work, including microservices per
operator and Kubernetes-based infrastructure, is currently maintained outside
this public repository and is not yet public.

## Prompt-Level Score Corridors

KSODI-Light may use rough score corridors such as:

```text
K=4, S=4, O=3, D=4, I=4
```

or domain-specific variants such as:

```text
K=4.8, S=4, O=4.9, D=4.9, I=4
```

Such corridors should be understood as context-specific expectations.

They can support simple fallback behavior:

```text
If O is below the required corridor for this task, ask for grounding before
answering.
```

At this level, the agent is being guided by prompt instructions. It is not yet
being formally audited by an external KSODI observer.

## Observer-Based Steering

Observer-based steering would be different.

It may involve:

- defined IK corridors,
- explicit fallback thresholds,
- drift detection,
- external feedback to an agent,
- escalation to a human or governance layer.

Such mechanisms require formal observation logic and should be described as
Standard-Eval, KSODI-Full or IDAS-level functionality.

## Target Groups

User or account prompts:

- help a user and assistant keep the shared working frame clear,
- make uncertainty and missing context visible,
- keep the assistant in a reflective collaboration mode.

Developer or system prompts:

- may embed K/S/O/D/I corridors,
- may define fallback behavior,
- may adapt expectations to domains or tasks.

Observer implementations:

- evaluate trajectories from outside the prompt,
- record drift and corridor movement over time,
- support audit, research and governance.

## Research Status

Prompt-score thresholds, operator weightings and observer settings should be
treated as empirical research questions.

They should be observed over time before becoming normative configuration
rules.

The public materials may be useful for orientation, training and discussion,
but formal implementation of KSODI Standard-Eval / Full requires careful layer
separation and operator-specific design. Public examples may be adapted by
others, but enterprise or regulated uses should treat the operator filling,
observer architecture, data boundaries and audit requirements as specialized
architecture work rather than as a simple copy-and-paste prompt pattern.
