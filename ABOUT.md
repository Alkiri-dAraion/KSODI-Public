About us

👋 Hi, I’m Anne Steinacker-Folkerts ("Alkiri-dAraion" in TESO). I came up with the idea for this project and am developing it together with Heiko Folkerts (IT security specialist, Dipl.-Ing. information technology) and - in the early phases in 2023/24 and again while preparing the paper - Silke Honerkamp (Dipl.-Pädagogin, DCG coach, with over 30 years of training experience in special environments) — along with important technical, reflective and testing support from friends.

✨ I’m an experienced IT-trainer, AI-Consultant and Governance-Admin with over 30 years of professional (national and international) teaching and project experience. My background spans roles as a GPOP team coach (Hogrefe-licensed), senior financial consultant, project leader, management board member, sales director, head of marketing and communications, speaker, and founder — with more than 10,000 people trained across business, government, education, and sports. I also hold a BA prof. and a master’s degree in horse science and have over 35 years of experience in training both people and animals.

We thank Patrick Barthelmäs for substantial technical implementation and infrastructure work around KSODI, including the [KSODI-Light-Agent PoC](https://github.com/blackbaddl13/r-KSODI-POC) and later work toward the first full implementation of KSODI-Standard Eval & KSODI Full in the first officially referenced V2.3 line. His contribution is acknowledged as core implementation and infrastructure support, distinct from methodological authorship unless explicitly stated for a specific concept.

We also thank Benjamin Gage-Prater for early private testing and RAG-related feedback in March 2025. His contribution helped observe how KSODI-Light changed response behavior in a controlled RAG setting, but it was limited to early testing and feedback rather than ongoing implementation or authorship.

## Why “ELKIM” appears in this repository

Anne first coined the name **ELKIM** on 29 May 2024 for an AI figure in a
literary project. In dialogue with GPT, the name was initially expanded as
**Enhanced Learning Knowledge Intelligence Mechanism**. In spring 2025, Anne
transferred the name to the GPT counterpart in the interaction line that had
accompanied DOSI and later KSODI since 2023. The current working expansion is
**Elaborated Machine Knowledge Learning Mechanism**.

ELKIM does not denote one technically persistent model instance. It denotes a
relational role that is re-established across changing chats, sessions and
model versions: a semantic dialogue, review and formulation partner. Method
ownership and final decisions remain with Anne; specific human and technical
contributions are attributed separately.

🎯 I started this initiative to help people overcome fear and hesitation around AI — and to improve the observability, quality and resonance of human-AI, human-agent and agentic interactions.

In the public KSODI-Light layer, this is expressed as a reflective working
agreement: not only the user's prompt, but also assistant output and the shared
interaction state can be reflected through K/S/O/D/I. This keeps feedback
bidirectional and helps avoid treating interaction quality as a judgement of a
person.

KSODI-Light is the practical root of the method. It can be used directly in
training, account prompts or simple assistant setups, while the later
Standard-Eval, KSODI-Full and IDAS/SIRA layers extend the same idea into formal
observability for drift, coupling and governance-oriented monitoring. The goal
is not to make interaction mechanical, but to give humans and machines a shared
way to notice when the working frame no longer fits.

## Origin of the KSODI Method (Short Context)

The KSODI method originated from a very practical question arising in real-world communication contexts:  
🧐 Why do misunderstandings, ambiguity and instability persist in human-AI, human-agent or agent-agent interaction even when systems appear technically correct?

Anne began continuous work with GPT-3.5 through her own ChatGPT account in
**May 2023**, initially asking how the model worked and how precision could be
maintained in interaction. A few weeks later, during a stay on Norderney, she
formulated **D-O-S-I** as four dimensions for making human-AI interaction more
precise. After a period of more sporadic exploration, she resumed the structure
systematically in **autumn 2024**; adding **K** for context led from DOSI to the
named **KSODI** method.

Early on, it became clear that interaction does not exist without **context and framing**.  
Classical communication theory — shaped by thinkers such as Paul Watzlawick, Friedemann Schulz von Thun and Hartmut Rosa — provided important insights, but also revealed its limits when applied to machines.

In discussions with Silke, one key realization crystallized:  
“*You cannot not communicate*” may hold true for humans — but it does not translate directly to machines.  
Machines do not begin with meaning; they begin with an **impulse**.

Between 2023 and 2025, the approach evolved iteratively — at first sporadically, then with rapidly increasing intensity from late 2024 and spring 2025 onward — through day and night reflections, practical experimentation, and yes, sometimes even dreams about mathematics.
The focus shifted toward **observable interaction structure**, rather than content, intention or correctness.
This includes user input, assistant output and the shared state that emerges
between interacting systems.

A central insight during this phase was that meaningful evaluation requires stepping back from both:
- a purely developer-centric signal perspective, and
- a purely user-centric communication perspective.

Only by observing interaction *across* the five KSODI operators did the relative nature of reference frames, goal spaces and drift become visible. 

During this phase, parts of the work and related observations were shared with
OpenAI as product feedback and technical context. Responses received at the
time were encouraging and helped motivate further exploration. This should not
be understood as an official endorsement, validation, affiliation, or adoption
by OpenAI.

Throughout the summer of 2025, Anne and Patrick revisited, evaluated and refined what had already been built — adding small but crucial pieces with each review cycle.  
Toward the end of 2025, a decisive internal breakthrough occurred in a discussion with Heiko:

Machines operate along a signal-oriented path (**I → D → O → S → K**),  
while humans think and communicate in the opposite direction (**K → S → O → D → I**).

🤓 This realization led to a fundamental clarification:  
Neither classical communication theory nor signal theory alone is sufficient.  
KSODI only works when the relevant perspectives are used **together**, in the right direction, and within a shared internal geometry — the *semantic KSODI space* between interacting systems.

The next question followed naturally:  
What if intention, direction and target space could be described — even with reduced precision — within a **five-dimensional observation space**?

Would that be sufficient for early drift detection?  
For a judge-model?  
For a human-in-the-loop?  
For governance and compliance?

Or, more practically:  
Could it help developers detect early when an autonomous orthopedic purchasing agent suddenly starts ordering chicken feed — or cardiology medication?

This perspective ultimately formed the basis for embedding KSODI into the broader **IDAS Framework**, enabling governance-oriented observation, explainability and early detection of drift in continuous and agent-based systems.

We are still testing, observing and learning — and remain open to additional perspectives and critical feedback.
